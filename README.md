<h1>Direwolf Dashboard</h1>
<b>Direwolf has no native Graphical User Interface so we will attempt to create one with PHP.</b>


<p>By adding sudo apt install PHP8.0 to the Direwolf Raspberry Pi, Apache2 is automatically added. So we have the possiblility of at least displaying the 
output to a browser.</p>

<p>It is essential that during the compilation of Direwolf, that you place the direwolf.conf file in /etc/direwolf directory. Also necessary will be the creating of the log file direwolf.log that should always reside in the /var/log directory.
  
<p>With these in place the system should display a dashboard on any browser pointing to the IP address of the connected Direwolf install.</p>
