<h1>Direwolf Dashboard</h1>
<b>Direwolf has no native Graphical User Interface so we will attempt to create one with PHP</b>


<p>By adding sudo apt install PHP8.0 to the Direwolf Raspberry Pi, Apache2 is automatically added. So we have the possiblility of at least displaying the 
output to a browser.</p>
